    Our guides have been exploring this region of Chile for years, always keeping up to date on the different techniques necessary for each tour, which gives a unique value to the guide.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each expedition seeks to have a maximum of 6 people so that the experience is truly personalized and of quality. In addition to the certified guide, an assistant will accompany us from the mid-mountain (in the process of training to be a professional guide) in this way we can have greater security and technical support when carrying out the activity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our purpose is to be a contribution to the community, which is why we try to include local services in almost all our 'outings', thus generating a pioneering support network in the region.
        <br />
        <br />
        All the guides receive training in the management and execution of techniques that represent a minimum impact on nature, which will be sought to transfer to the passengers in each guided tour.
